# Decisions made during development
During development, I made multiple decisions in order to ensure the quality and security of my webpage.
For example, I esnured to prepare, bind and execute all SQL Statements, in order to protect against SQL injection.
I also ensured to use colours that allowed for good accessibility and readability, as well as a readable font. As a result,
my webpage is accessible for everyone. 

Another decision I made, was to utilise the pages from my previous assignment. I did this to save time and resources, as the main layout and input was already complete.
